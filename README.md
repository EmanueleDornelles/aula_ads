# 📘 aula_ads — Python Exercises for ADS

## 📌 About the Repository

This repository contains a collection of **Python programming exercises** developed for the **ADS (Analysis and Systems Development)** course.
The exercises focus on fundamental programming concepts such as:

* Input and output
* Conditional statements
* Mathematical calculations
* Functions
* Menus
* Date manipulation
* Logical decision-making

Each file corresponds to a specific exercise proposed during class.

## 🛠 Requirements

* **Python 3.x**
* No external libraries are required (except `datetime`, which is part of Python’s standard library).

## ▶️ How to Run the Programs

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/EmanueleDornelles/aula_ads.git
cd aula_ads
```

2. Run any exercise:

```bash
python exe01.py
```

Replace `exe01.py` with the desired exercise file.
